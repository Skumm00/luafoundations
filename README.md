Above is a series of works I created in Lua to establish my language understanding. Similar to a previous project I worked on in hack club, it features a do-it-yourself tutorial on Lua and its basic syntax, ranging from the easiest to the most challenging. It also includes a built-in search function to run only the units you want to. Overall, the project has been difficult but fun to learn. To run the code, download the GitHub repository, open it in your editor (I recommend VS Code), and see the results. Then On the console, you can see all the results. Compared to a traditional UI, I decided to not make one and have the user put their own input on 9 different units which they can each run, and even a little story game project at the end! I did this because I want to keep the experience of coding for everyone the same so that even someone who doesn't know how to code can do this project.

How to use it.
To use it, simply download the repo(use github codespaces) and then open it in your proferred text editor such as VS Code and run the code and you can interact with it in the console.(Easiest way because this isn't a python file but lua)
