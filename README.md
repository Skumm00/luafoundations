Here is a serires of works i made in lua to build my foundations on the language. similary to a project I made before on hackclub it features sort of a do-it-yourself tutorial on lua and its basic syntax ranging from the easiest to the hardest. It also has a inbuilt searching function so that you can run only the units you want to. Overall the project has been challenging but fun to learn. To run the code download the github repo and open it in your editor(I reccomend VS Code) and see the results.
